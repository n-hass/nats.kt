**NATS.kt** is a high-performance NATS client built specifically for Kotlin Multiplatform. Powered by Ktor's networking stack, it brings NATS messaging to every platform Kotlin supports - including servers, mobile apps, browsers and native applications.

## ✨ Why NATS.kt?

- **🌐 Universal Platform Support**: Deploy your NATS-powered applications anywhere Kotlin runs
- **🏗️ Transport Flexibility**: TCP and WebSocket transports supported 
- **🤝 Coroutines**: Coroutine-based API for idiomatic reactive programming
- **🔧 Developer-First**: Clean, idiomatic Kotlin API with DSL configuration
- **⚡ Built on Ktor**: Leverage Ktor's stability for networking capabilities and performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Gradle:

```kotlin
commonMain.dependencies {
	implementation("io.github.n-hass:natskt-core:0.1.1")
}
```

### Basic Usage

```kotlin
import io.natskt.NatsClient

// Simple connection
val client = NatsClient("nats://localhost:4222")
client.connect()

// Advanced configuration
val client = NatsClient {
    server = "nats://localhost:4222"
    transport = TcpTransport
}

val client = NatsClient {
    server = "ws://localhost:4222"
    transport = WebSocketTransport.Factory(CIO)
}

// Subscribe to messages
val subscription = client.subscribe("orders.new")
subscription.messages.collect { message ->
    println("Received: ${message.payload}")
}
```

**Legend**: ✅ Complete | 🚧 In Progress | ❌ Planned

My priority right now is to reach a good level of stability and correctness with all JetStream consumer features,
then to go back and address any performance optimisations that can be made.

## 🛡️ Security

Please do not rely on the NKEY/Creds authentication features included in this client in a production environment. Although functionally correct, some cryptographic operations have not been formally verified and may have vulnerabilities. 

The NKEY implementation uses an Ed25519 algorithm implementation from an [un-attested library](https://github.com/andreypfau/curve25519-kotlin). This is used to sign authentication requests by the server on connect.

I plan to move the NKEY implementation to use [cryptography-kotlin](https://github.com/whyoleg/cryptography-kotlin), a multiplatform binding to various other platform-native attested libraries, like JCA, OpenSSL and WebCrypto. This is waiting on the features being developed in that library upstream.

The rest of the secure operations, including [secure-random](https://github.com/whyoleg/cryptography-kotlin) and TLS for TCP and WebSocket transports, use implementations which delegate to platform-native libraries and should not pose a notable security risk.
